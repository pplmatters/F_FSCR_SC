# F_FSCR_SC

This is the first proect designed on my own. An android app that uses F-FCSR stream cipher algorithmn to encrypt text files. It was developped in 2017 and I submmited it as my design for assessment before graduation. i know it sucks, but that's where I started. It's my mark building from 0 to 1.
